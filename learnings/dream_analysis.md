# Dream Analysis & Speaking the Language of the Subconscious

We all have vivid dreams that we remember months, maybe even years after we had them. Some dreams seem signficant to us, hiding important messages in plain sight, asking us to do the work to interpret them and integrate the lessons. 

Dreams are communications from the subconscious. They speak in a very different language than one we are used to. Dreams speak in images, metaphors, feelings, colors, and plots. It is challenging, but very rewarding to begin to learn the language of the subconscious. 

Through this language we can learn many insights about ourselves and the people important to us. These insights are useful from a variety of perspectives: 
    - dreams allow us to see the evolution of the state of our subconscious over time
    - dreams give us clues about memories or beliefs that might be soaking up much of our psyche's energy
    - dreams provide hints about where the "path out" might start from, or what we need to call into our lives for the next stage of growth
    - dreams can give us a perspective on others around us or external events that is unblemished from ego-consciousness input

Of course, we are just scratching the surface of the power of the subconscious. The goal in this document is to learn a process by which to communicate with the subconscious. Analysis of dreams for personal development is a great starting point. This road goes very far and very deep. 

## Getting started

Start where you are. Next to your bed keep a paper journal and a pen you enjoy to use. Your notebook and pen should be closer to you than your phone is. When you wake up, write down something, anything. I often will write down "I had a dream but I dont remember it. I remember feeling impatient." Or anything that is on your mind first thing after you wake up. Initially, you need to convince your subconscious that you are there listening, paying attention, and willing to do the work together. This might take time. Writing down dreams is the best and easiest way to improve your dream recall ability. It's a practice. Gotta go to the gym every day. 

Many people claim to not have dreams. This could be a couple things: you could be having dreams and not remembering them, you could actually not be getting to the stage of sleep when your brain goes into dream mode, your subconscious might not have anything to share with you at that time, or something else.



## A Process for Dream Analysis
This process for dream analysis comes from a book called Inner Work by Robert Johnson. 

1. Start by writing down the dream. From here, extract out key images, persons, and plots. Images refer to aspects of the dream which are metaphor. This could be the setting (a beach, the ocean, a house, an old town), items (sunscreen, fish, a door, Facebook HQ), something more esoteric such as color (finding a child in a green room), time-of-day (dusk), or something your dream character does (excitement from discovering how to fly, or a feeling of anxiousness as you move through unknown land). List out images which seem relevant or important sequentially, down the left side of a page leaving space between each image.

2. Put the dream aside and brainstorm associations that come to you from the images you have listed down. Cast the net wide. What associations do you make to a beach? Fun and playful? Time spent with loved ones? Fishing or sport? Danger and fear? Take the time to brainstorm associations for each image you have listed on the paper. Be sure to write down each one. 

3. Map the associations to situations in your life. Going back to the beach example, what situation in your life might have something to do with fun and being playful? Or situations spending time with loved ones? Past events or future plans for water sport and surfing? A thought that leaves you feeling emotions of danger and fear? Try to find life-associations for each of the image-associations from Step 2. Write these down.

4. Now, take step back (maybe even literally) and look for the narrative. Can you draw a link between the metaphors from step 2 and the associations from step 3, that combined give a full story? Try to find a narrative that makes sense from a metaphorical standpoint, and one that makes sense on how it maps to your physical life. Spend some time on this, but ultimately trust your instinct. 

5. Establish a physical ritual from your interpretation. This is integration and it is most important. Bring the lesson from the dream into reality. This doesnt have to be a grand gesture but it should be meaningful to you. It can be alone or with others. However, as it is a ritual, it should be approached with intentionality and respect. Some examples: for the dream & interpretaion that fast food is damaging an individual's health and relationship, a ritual is to buy a burger and give it a proper burial with a eulogy and all (actually bury it); for the dream & interpration that a way to combat addiction to marijuana is by calling upon childhood joys, a ritual is to buy a joint and give it a cremation in the presence of toys and printouts of characters from favorite cartoons. 

## Going Deeper

### Practice
This process is a time-consuming one, as it should be. Not every dream needs the full treatment - you'll know which ones are worth it. The good thing is that it gets easier over time. You and your subconscious will begin to handshake on common interpretations and themes. As you process a dream and seal the interpretation with a ritual, it is at best an informed guess. Later on your subconscious might serve you a slightly modified dream to help you get closer to the message your subconscious wants to communicate with you. 

### Themes
You might notice in both examples of ritual above, there is a general theme of death and release. As you do this work over time you'll notice certain themes: about images (e.g. water and emotion, snakes and transformation), or about motifs and narratives (e.g. death & rebirth, initiation into the next phase of life, the hero's journey). This aspect goes very deep. Jung said each our our subconscious reaches into and draws inpiration from a collective subconscious. And messages from this collective play out again and again in literary epics (The Oddessy), mythology (a person saving humanity from calamity) and religion (a manifestation of the divine onto earth to show us the way). Studying history, myths, literary, and artistic expression in general help both in providing the subconscious a rich vocabularity with which it can express itself, and scaffolding for you to find it easier to grasp and itegrate deeper and larger interpretations.  

## The Subconscious Speaks
Dreams are one of the ways in which subconscious speaks to us, but not the only way. We can directly seek counsel with the subconsious using techniques like hypnosis and active imagination. We can also keep some level of awareness and see the influence of the subconscious in our waking states too by paying attention to our daydreams. Deeper still, we may seek to enter deep medidative states either through focused meditation or assisted through sound. And at the most extreme, we may seek guidance from plant medicines. 

We can also speak to the subconscious. Of course, passively, it is there consuming all the sensory input we are receiving in our waking state (and more, since some input gets filtered out at a subconscious level). We can bolster this effect by being intentional about what diet we feed our subconscious. And we can take an active approach as well by seeking to directly communicate with the subconscious (though communication via words will not be effective). An example of this is inner child work, and the book Psychocybernetics (by Dr.Maltz, first edition preferred), goes into much more detailed techniques.
