# Breathwork

Breathwork is a crucial skill - it allows us to directly interface with our nervous system. By learning how to breath with intention we can influence the state of our nervous to attain a variety of outcomes ranging from reduction of stress and relaxation to altered and psychedelic states. 

For the untrained person, breath will reflect the nervous system state. Someone agitated or stressed will have a breath that is shallow and rapid. Someone relaxed and calm will have a breath that is deeper and slower. 

The process of breathwork is pretty simple: breath for the nervous system state you want. There are specific techniques that have stood the test of time that are very effective to induce the changes we wish to see. These techniques are outlined below. 

Building the interface takes time. A 5-minute daily practice is perfect to get started. Your nervous system takes time to be trained to respond to breath. Be patient. And when you start to see results, keep going!

There is much to write about breath, and much that has been written already. This is a living document and will continute to evolve.
