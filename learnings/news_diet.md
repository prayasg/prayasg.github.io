# JUUL Labs, Teen Vaping, and Ingredients of a Healthy News Diet

I worked at JUUL Labs, a company that sells nicotine vaporizers, for a number of years. I am still recovering from the whiplash from working there. The first few months of working there, wearing my JUUL branded backpack and jacket proudly on the Caltrain and around San Francisco, numerous strangers would strike up conversation sharing how JUUL or other vaporizors helped them transition off cigarettes. Some quit nicotine completely. Others continued to vape. All shared an improvement in their quality of life. 

It felt good to be a part of a group making such an impact. Those stranger's stories matched my own. I smoked (my vice was marijuana instead of tobacco). Not long after starting smoking the negative health effects became obvious. I found vaping to be a decent middle ground - lesser physical effects while providing the mental effects I desired to numb myself of heavy emotional pain. I stayed in that in between phase for quite a while until I was able to quit altogether. Vaping significantly reduced the amount of toxic smoke I might have otherwise consumed over the years. 

I knew I wasnt alone. Many others shared my story who worked at JUUL. I would say roughly 1/4 to 1/3 of the folks who worked there when I joined used vaping as a part of their journey off cigarettes either directly or indirectly (e.g. supporting a loved one). I was hesitant to work for a "sin company." That was one of the big draws for me to working there.  Many people had been in that place, everyone could relate. Everyone seemed sincere about the (unofficial) mission of putting cigarettes in their grave. 

Within a few months of my start date, the first bits of news about the teen vaping epidemic started to come out. Within weeks the mood in the city soured. I would still wear my JUUL branded jacket - I still believed in the mission. That soon stopped. One morning while waiting for the Caltrain at the Menlo Park station a woman accosted me screaming at me about how I am poisoning and killing children, how I am the incarnation of the devil. I won't forget the look in her eye. Thankfully the train came soon and I was able to put distance between myself and her. That day I went and bought a plain black backpack. I havent work that JUUL jacket since. 

I had heard of media being referred to the "fourth pillar" or "fourth estate." Certainly the media is powerful - our AP US History teacher certainly emphasized it. Seeing it firsthand made it real through. It was really remarkable how over the span of weeks the mood completely changed. I couldnt help but wonder about the woman - why was she so upset? I dont mean that dismissively - seriously why was she so upset? Did her child get seriously ill or die? What could have caused such a visceral reaction from her? 

Over the coming months, I was gifted with front row seats to what I can only describe as a media meltdown. We had an internal slack channel where news pieces would be posted. The hit pieces formed a deluge. And I read every single one. That channel would be the first thing I checked in the morning. And reading those articles would fill me with all sorts of emotions: dread, anger, confusion, frustration, and more. 

How could I not have those reactions? My identity was challenged. There was the perpetual question of what my employment is supporting - is it a net benefit to society or a harm? And was my experience with vaping really that unique? Was the "truth" of my work being sequested to me so I could continue to be productive at work? Could the news be trusted? Or was it all "fake news" as a certain president would loudly and regularly proclaim?

I wanted to know the truth. 

As a member of the data team, I was knowledable about the reality of the industry - who was selling what and how much (no one knew who was buying). But more interestingly, I worked alongside the research scientists who were actively working with various universities and research institutitons with the goal of understanding the impact of our products. I spent a lot of time with them. 

I wasn't convienced that we were all drinking the koolaide at work so I took it upon myself to conduct my own outside research. I reached out in my network to a variety of doctors and had a chat with them. I talked to maybe 10 total. Some were practing, others were in med school. They shared a certain perspective. I trust that they were real with me since we had a personal connection first and a professional connection second. 

I found myself again in a unique position. Media frenzy wasnt new any more. Trump had been in office for a few years now. But this was the first frenzy in which I had a considerable amount of information about the topic being discussed - both first-hand and second-hand. That position helped me analyze all the commenatary that was out there. I was shocked at how many "reputable" organizations would publish outright lies or half truths. It was eye opening to see how opinions and stances could be manufactured. 

This experience helped me assess which news outlets were reliable and stuck to facts and which ones were flexible with facts. That perspective helped me assess which outlets were more interested in presenting an informed position vs those who were in the business of generating outrage and emotional reactions. 

A lot came out of riding that media wave. I dont think this is the place to share my personal opinions on the topic of vaping, health, government policy, and where to draw the line between personal responsiblity and public accountability. I dont want to name names (but there are definitely big name news orgs I will never read or subscribe to.) However I would like to share the personal rules I follow to build a nutritious news diet. 

## What to avoid in news

**If the news makes you feel strong (negative) emotions like anger or rage, its not healthy.** What is the purpose of news? Education and information or entertainment? Information and education is generally bland. Entertainment is usually spicy and flavorful. Are you being provided a balanced, pragmatic take? Are you being given facts for you to come to your own conclusion? Or is all the hard thinking being done for you and are you being provided with a packaged conclusion to adopt? 

**If the news is free, you are the product.** Any organization needs money to operate, and generally people pursue profit. Follow the money. Who benefits? This is true both for the subject of the news itself and for the publishing organization. The "trust bar" for a free news org is very very high. 

**If the outlet is free, and causes strong emotions, most likely they are trying to addict you.** Unfortunately unscrupulous organizations have discovered that humans can get addicted to negative emotions. This couples nicely with the first point. If the org makes money each time you visit, they have a strong incentive to keep you coming back for more. Additionally, a human's reasoning capability is diminished when under the influence of strong emotions. This is even more valuable to an advertisor who is trying to seperate you from your money. Once you see this, you can't unsee it. 

**If the news source is from the same country the subject is about, be sensitive to propoganda.** A US news company reporting on US news isnt immedietly cause for alarm but be careful for subtly biased takes. If you truly want a well rounded and informed opinion, add reputable international organizations to your mix. Certain countries suffer from biased news more than others. Stay alert. 

## Principles for a healthy news diet

**You have to pay for it.**

**The news should be bland, not spicy.**

**The article should provide multiple perspectives. You should have to think for a while to come to a conclusion.**

**The news should come from outside the country you are interested in.**


The best way to construct your own news diet is to ride your own media wave. You need to be deeply knowledgable about a topic and need to be attentive as you weather through the media storm.  

Until then, pay for your boring news.
