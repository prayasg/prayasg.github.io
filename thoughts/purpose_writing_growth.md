# Purpose, Writing, and Growth
#### May 2023

I've had this dream of becoming a writer for quite some time. I would sit with my carefully curated notebook and pen. The blank page and I would stare at each other, not knowing how to proceed. I would like to share my thoughts, use my voice. It was difficult. The words didn't come, there was no flow. Eventually the writing would turn into a journaling exercise - still very useful. But hardly qualifying towards becoming a writer. 

Maybe there is a lesson about attachment there - attchment to the identity of writing over the utility of it. Today I want to focus from the perspective of purpose. 

To write you must have something to say. Optionally, its helpful to be able to say it well. It's as easy or as difficult as that. And, at that point, the act of writing is almost incidental. You might realize the point you want to make can be better served in a different medium such as a gaze, or a drawing, or best yet to be left in the aether. 

So, writing for me has become a means to an end. There are quite a few things I want to say - that makes it so much easier to write. It is clear when to start and when to stop. I know what direction is north. Feedback is instant. Active voice comes naturally. Dropping into that state of flow is so much easier. Verbosity is easier to control. There is a certain amount of pleasure it in now, a wholesome one rather than one from want. 

What shifted? Finding a purpose to move with. 

This is generally true as well. It is signficantly easier to move forward once you have found purpose. The desire to be somewhere, or do something. A well of inspiration and motivation and discipline opens from deep within. It becomes a compulsion, almost. You are punished for not heeding the call. 

As it relates to growth and personal development, purpose is most useful. In my own story, I strove to do better and get well for the sake of it - I just wanted to feel better. The compass I was using had happiness as its north. That took me in circles. It became too easy to become attached to the identify of "someone who does the work." Not only was the effort not translating to results, it created this judgemental attitude in me, that I was better than those who didn't do the work. That fed into a vicious cycle of stagnation. 

This new compass has purpose at its north. Now, having somewhere to be brings much clarity. What do I need to do next? Is what I am doing aligned? What else do I need to be doing? Is it okay to take a break and rest? Do I have to do this alone, or can I find others to join with? Do I listen to this critical voice in my head or keep going? And the best part, I happen to find little pockets of happiness on the way - much more reliably than what I had found using that old happiness compass. 

Interesting, it became much easier to "do the work" after finding this purpose because then doing the work became necessary. I needed to move forward but couldn't do so with all this baggage I was carrying around. I needed to put it down. I needed to find a way to put it down. I needed to find help to find a way to put it down. Somehow, putting that baggage away became much easier because I knew to get to where I wanted to be this had to go.

How can you find purpose? No one knows but you. Thats the beautiful thing - its totally in your control. To start, cultivate elemnts of both the masculine and feminine. 

Feminine first. Learn to be receptive. Learn to be soft - especially towards yourself. Listen to your body. Rest. Create that fertile soil within yourself so that seeds of inspiration can take root. Find your intuition - that inner voice that whispers things. It should sound just a little crazy, a little scary, and a little exciting. 

Then cultivate the masculine. The doing. Action. Discipline and follow through. Walk calmly into the ice water, the uncomfortable starting point, and find stillness, find that in you which will keep you going. Practice finding that again and again. Literally go sit in ice water. Do the work to water that seed and tend to it. 

However you get there, in whatever way that you are able to, birth that crazy little idea into reality. Small steps of course. Maybe its saying hi to that random person you are drawn to. Maybe its going on random little get together posted by someone whom you barely remember (how do I know that guy??) just because it sounds cool. Maybe its following through on the thing you signed up on even though now you have cold feet and really don't want to do it. 

Whatever it is, do it.
