# On minds
#### March 2021

In us exist three minds: the animal, the rational, and the divine. These minds have the capacity to influence the decisions we make and each have their place. Imbalance in the power of each of these minds causes issues. Understanding yourself and your minds provides a means to improving the decisions you will have to make in life. 
  
The animal mind is our primal self. It is the faculty from which the fight or flight response emerges. It also is responsible for base emotions such as anger, jealous, greed, and so on. The animal mind does not concern itself with issues of morality. Its directive is to survive and propogate. Its priority is to seek out pleasure and avoid pain. 

The rational mind is the relm of the ego. It is that part of the mind concerned with self-preservation. The rational mind learns patterns and distills them into hueristics in order to ease the cost of living. It constructs narratives and seeks understanding over the envionment as a means of exercising control. Its priority is to question, to doubt, and to rationalize the experience of life. 

The divine mind is that piece of the cosmic universe in each of us. Your soul, if you are religious. This is that inner voice that knows what is true, what is right, what is sacred. It whispers truths of the universe and provides guidance and hope in trying times. This is the seat of morality. The divine mind *knows* certain truths. 

In any situation which requires us to act, each of these minds will provide a response. The appropriate response is of course situation dependent. Rationalizing in a life-or-death situation might not be ideal nor will trusting animal instinct in contemplating a major investment. 

An undeveloped mind is dangerous in that it will often rely on animal responses and judge itself from a divine or rational standpoint (e.g. the guilt associated with adultry or addiction). 

The developed mind will cultivate the following:
- the ability to understand each of the minds, and their propoals in response to a stimuli  
- the mindfulness and strength to deliberately choose and act upon the response from the appropriate mind  
- the foresight to actively train the animal and rational minds
