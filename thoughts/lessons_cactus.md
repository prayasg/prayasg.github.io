# Lessons from the Cactus
#### May 2023
*ðŸŒµ Gratitude to the cactus and all the plant teachers*

There is much to learn from the humble cactus. It grows tall and wide in a land barren and a climate most inhospitable. It finds ways to thrive in spite of those who seek to extract life and resources from it. Yet it also becomes a sanctuary and a home for those who seek to coexist. And, in fleeting moments it opens up its well protected treasure to produce flowers of exquisite beauty for those lucky enough (and patient enough) to see it. 

Their primary means of defense is to grow spines, little daggers pointed outwards. You interact with a cactus on its terms, not your own. You cannot devour a cactus or consume it whole -- it is too well protected from that. Each cactus shows you how it would like to be approached, from what angle and from what direction. 

We, like cactus, build spines and walls too. Maybe around our heart or those tender parts of ourselves we wish to not get hurt. This comes from a desire for safety. And if we dont find that safety in the environment around us we try and find it within ourselves. 

So what lessons can we draw?

**The cactus grows spines in response to threats that exist around it.** The spines are not the truth of the cactus. In an ideal world the cactus would not need nor have any spines. However spines are necessary in response to threats from the environment. The environment is the truth of the spines, the main cause.

For us, our walls and spines and defences are not our truth either. Observe any child. They exist openly because they do not yet understand the idea of threats. But if that feeling of safety is taken away by a harsh environment or by preaders that roam looking for victims, then the defences come up. The defences are an effect from an external cause. 

**The cactus must find balance and only grow the appropriate amount of spines in order to thrive.** The cactus with too few spines will be devoured and robbed of its life energy. The cactus with too many spines will cut itself off from light and life and wither away. It will continuously expend energy in an attempt to protect itself but create a shadow too powerful to excape from. In order to thrive it must match its defenses with the environment it lives in.

For us, we too must find balance. Some of us, we willingly lay down our defences and allow others to extract too much from us because we feel must do so in order to find love and security. We could benefit from better defences-boundaries, the ability to say no and stand behind it. The courage to walk away if necessary.

For others, we feel far too threatened. We might have had traumatic experiences that robbed our feeling of safety at the core of our being. And so we grow too many spines. We find protection at the cost of the inability to make real connections or deep connections. We stay in our little castle safe and perhaps looking out the window watching life pass us by. 

So we must find balance. This is not easy. It begins by seeing our environment objectively. This is challenging because these feelings of danger and a lack of safety exist at a level below where our mind may be able to reach. This deep hard-wiring adds a tint to our vision that colors everything we see-limiting our ability to see reality as it is. These unconscious patterns must be made conscious. We must become aware first of ourselves.

Next, with some level of awareness that what we are seeing is in some part reality and some part projections from our past, we must try to see reality for what it is. We must see ourselves for what we are. Only then will we know in which direction we must grow: more spines or less? 

**Growing or shedding spines requires much time, patience, and energy.** Nature operates at a different timescale than we do in our modern life. Adjusting the number of spines takes time and a tremendous amount of energy. Cacti learn to coexist with natural cycles preserving resources in times of difficulty (winter and summer) and capitalizing on times of abundunce (monsoon, spring). Plants are said to move but at a rate too slow for us to perceive. They benefit from a constant environment and strong genetic programming. Our task is more challenging.

As we calibrate our defences to our environment we too must be patient. Taking that first step requires a tremendous amount of courage, that we are opening ourselves to hurt. It also requires faith, that the risk is worth it. We might stand for a long time at the edge of the pool before we jump in. Thats okay. 

Like the cacti, we should align our investments with the state of the environment around us. We should lean into growth when things are chill and there is room to breath. We shouldnt try to push growth too hard when the environment is unstable or we are already pressured in other ways. We must learn to work with our environment, not against it or inspite of it. 

Changing habits and patterns, especially the deep ones, takes signficant time and energy. Change requires the neurons themselves to shift-perhaps growing new ones or changing the interconnections between existing ones. We must change the hardwiring. Treat this like going to the gym. You wont see results in days or weeks. Maybe in months little things. Maybe in years bigger shifts. Consistency over everything. 

**Overcorrection is guarenteed--this evolution requires grace and perserverance.** Progress is never linear. The process of evolution keeps organisms in sync with the environment and the ecosystem at large. This happens largely through feedback loops. One season too few spines, and the cactus gets munched on. The next season too many spines, and it is starved of sunlight. And as the seasons go it learns and adapts, making an attempt and observing the response to the evniroment in order to find the delicate balance. This process in nature never stops. For the cactus, stopping this process means death. 

For us, it is important to recognize this pattern of over-correction and under-correection as a fundamental aspect of reality. It's the same process that we go through when we try to find the perfect shower temperature in a new house. Turn the water on, its too hot, turn it lower, its too cold, and we wiggle the dial around, each correction getting smaller and smaller, until we think its good enough for now. 

Our first attempts will certainly not be successful. For those of us with too many spines, we might drop too many of them leaving ourselves exposed. For those of us with too few, we might put on far more spines than we need. Of course the environment will test us. That is inevitable. And we will be caught lacking. That too is inevitable. We will be quick to fall back into the old patterns. That is also inevitable. 

But simply recognizing that you are in an old pattern again is tremendous growth. And recognizing that we will overshoot and undershoot and overshoot again might remind us to be gentle with ourselves. This is a long game and the only way to win is to perservere. For that, we must be on our own side. We can not do this if we judge ourselves too harshly or keep unrealistic expectations. Ease and grace. 

There is much that nature has to teach us. Open yourself to the lessons she provides. Keep your eyes open and your prespective curious. Spend time in the desert. It is a magical place. And if you ever need reminding of these lessons, spend time with a cactus.
