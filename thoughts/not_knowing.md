# Be Okay Not Knowing
#### May 2023


Psychedelics are cool because they allow you to explore the machinary that is your mind. This exploration would be probably be impossible to most of us otherwise. I would like to spend some time sharing my exploration with the narrative-generation aspect of the mind. 

By narrative-generation, I mean the minds innate desire to make sense of things. Presumably, it was and is beneficial to our survival to make sense of things. And beyond survival, our ability to reason and communicate has propelled us to modern hights. Its a big deal. And for us little individuals, much work is out there on the importance of narratives and storytelling. Enough about that.

I am starting to notice a trend in my plant medicine journies. Initially, the first ones were mystical and profound. Dancing across the cosmos. Interacting with divine creatures. Traveling back and forward and across time to other places and interacting with other beings. Being the river of life and in the river of life. You get the idea.

Now those visuals are all but gone. In its place now is more nebulous sensations. Feelings. Colors. Knowing. Melting. Discombobulating and recombobulating. Where did the visuals go?

My hypothesis: The narrative-generation mechanism of my mind quiets as I gain familiarity with the plant medicine space because it is more familiar - I have less of a need to make sense of what is happening and instead can surrender to the reality of the experience. 

(A quick note, it gets really confusing to talk about "minds" because I feel there are multiple minds active in there: The normal conscious ego-mind, a nebulous subconscious or unconscious mind, a reptilian-animalistic mind, a divine mind, maybe others. Its hard to keep them straight. This focus of this text is about the normal conscious ego-mind. Thats the one reading this wondering wtf is this guy on)

The mind really wants to make sense of things. Its probably that way by design. Its a very useful mode to operate in-beneficial for our survival. Understanding how deer behave, understanding how tools and wood can be made into weapons, knowing a common language with your tribe, a communicated tradition of hunting tactics all come together to make sure we were well fed and could thrive. Useful stuff. 

The mind is a story generating machine. All it needs is a couple facts, a couple of draws from past experiences, some creativity and boom! You have a narrative. The narrative is much easier to remember, to communicate, than the random bundle of observations. Can we even seperate those from the tint our past experiences? Is that tint relevant to whom we are communicating this to? 

**Learning to recognize and work with this narrative-generation property of the mind is very important. It is a valuable tool. It can also get us into trouble. Learning when to reign it in and when to lean on it is a very valuable skill to cultivate.** This property can and will get us into trouble unchecked. 

One way it can get us into trouble is when we conflate understanding with reason and reason's child, words. There are many things beyond reason (us as individuals in our totality, for example, or our experience with the divine, or even the experience of being in nature). Trying to put something that lies beyond reason into reason or into words is by definition a futile task. Trying to force that will result in one or a both of the following: chopping off the weird bits and taking the life out of it, like a bug floating in formaldyhide; personal distress because it'll be obvious our attempts to describe or label the thing isn't working but we keep trying anyway. Straight into the frustration-zone. Reign it in. 

Another way it can get us into trouble is by blurring the line between an oberservation and what we project onto reality. Witness testimony is one of the lowest forms of evidence in court for this reason. People remember narratives, not facts. So when trying to recall a past event we conjure up the narrative we made about it. Some aspects of that might be fact, much of the remaining blanks will be filled in by what makes sense to us in the context of that narrative even if it is completely made up. Worse, that narrative can be manipulated by external parties either intentionally or unintentionally. Presumibly we are interested in knowing the facts as a proxy for truth. This is obviously problematic. Recognize this blind spot, be aware of your own limitations, take actions to minimize this. 

Most insidiously, this faculty will limit our ability to make sense of and comprehend ourselves and all the other interesting complicated bits of reality that we care about. If we limit our understanding to that which can fit into words or labels or reason, well that doesn't leave much. And that certainly doesnt leave room for anything alive. We will be limiting to understanding only that which fits into neat little boxes we make for ourselves. What will happen when we run into something that wont fit in the box? That will continue to evolve? The risk is that we become blind to it, blind to the reality of it. We might only see what allow ourselves to see. We must look past a narrow, reason-based paradigm of understanding. Its too blunt a tool for the delicate intricacies and fluid nature of life and the divine. 

Enough negative stuff. Lets celebrate this aspect of our mind, the narrative-engine. It makes life so fun. It is creativity. It enables language and helps with connection to one annother. Is is tradition and those stories from our parents and elders. Stories touch us deeply. Great stories touch on something beyond each of us, something common. (The Odessey has been on my mind a lot lately. Maybe 2500 years after it was written and still going strong.) This aspect of our mind keeps us safe. It helps us comprehend and work with our environment and with each other. 

So, learn to recognize this property of the mind. Learn how to work with it. More importantly, learn how to work without it too. **Be okay not knowing.**
