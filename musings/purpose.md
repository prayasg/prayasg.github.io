# On Purpose and Progress
#### March 2021  
  
## Purpose
My purpose is simple: to be awake and free. 
  
Awake to the truths of this universe. Free from fear, from suffering, from the tyranny of the self.

To live my best life for no reason other than I choose to and I am free to. 
  

## Progress
Below is a rough guide of an individual's progress towards acheiving freedom. I make no claims that these thoughts are unique. The scaffolding for these ideas has been heavily inspired by [this post.](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office/)

A person can be called awake when they are aware of the truths of the universe and are not ruled by their fear. But its only those rare few who start here. Most of us start off asleep-unaware of the reality of this universe and too busy distracting ourselves with shiny things. There is a phase in between asleep and awake. I call this phase aware. The person who is aware recognizes the truths of the universe but is still subject to the tyranny of fear. They are not yet ready to live their best lives. 
  
(For those who have read that post linked above: asleep = clueless, aware = loser, awake = sociopath).

The asleep are adrift in [samsara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra_(Buddhism)) but of course they don't know this. That's what they are asleep to. They accept things (e.g. religion, purpose) not because they have done the hard things to come to their own level of understanding but because they accept it wholesale from an external factor (family, institutions, society). Usually people wake up on their own once the wave of reality comes crashed down and shattering the illusions of the dream world they construct for themselves. Ignorance is bliss. 
  
The aware recongize that there is something beyond existance as we see it. They are no longer asleep but they are also not yet ready to get out of that warm and cozy bed. Who can blame them? The universe is a scary place. They are dissatisfied with simply being perscribed a purpose but have not yet undertaken the difficult task of conducting their own analysis of themselves, this universe, and the relationship between the two. The hard way is figuring things out for themselves. The easy way is to numb themselves via relationships, drugs, and the like or to distract themselves by diving into work or some hobby. Most unfortunately, only they can help themselves out of this place. 
  
The awakened operate independently and freely. They act not to please any external entities but purely for themselves. They act in a way free from the tyranny of fear. Maybe an eligntened few do not feel fear at all, the rest recognize fear and the courage to act anyway. They will have their own morals and principles derived from their own experiences. They channel their energy and create independently of public opinion.
