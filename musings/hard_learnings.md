- To recognize which situations are sprints, which are marathons, and to exert yourself accordingly
- To recognize that not losing is different from winning, and that often not losing is better
- To be weary of the pursuit of perfection, for often it comes from a place of fear and is poisonous
- To evaluate yourself only on the decision you made, your assessment of the situation and of options available, and probabilities of likely outcomes (which are in your control) but not the outcome (which is not in your control, or an unknown unknown)
- To remember: Don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror. You aren't going that way

- To always be aware of your strength 
- To be willing and capable of doing the hard things whatever they may be. Note: nothing which is worth it comes easy - you must persevere. But if you fall short, to love yourself as you would love your child who made a mistake. For those times when you did choose the easy way over the hard way, right those wrongs to the best of your ability. Commit to doing better, work on your foundation, don't compromise on your principles or values. 
- To remember, moments are temporary. Now only barely exists. This too, will pass. 
- To allow yourself to be bored, to even seek out boredom, and to not mask that feeling with passive or pointless distractions

- To respect yourself and others
- To not tolerate disrespect towards yourself or others
- To remember, everything in this universe has its place. To not infringe on the space which belongs to others. To learn from the harmony in which universe operates
- To liberally add in chaos. Order is often unnatural
- To remember death is not the enemy, an inevitably, a promise made at birth. To fear death is to mistake your enemy; your enemy is fear. 
- To remember that any one of us could die at any moment for any reason. That life changes on a dime. Don't lose sight of the big picture. To celebrate frequently and without reason. But don't use this as an excuse to not invest in yourself. 
- To remember that this universe is absurd, and often deliciously so
- To be wary when you feel the need to exert control externally (a situation or a person). Often, it comes from a place of fear or insecurity. True love and strength are found in freedom

- To remember that change is the only truth 
- To remember that while the universe is rational, your ability to comprehend that rationality is limited 
- To remember that your freedom can never be taken from you, only you have the power to give it away
- To compare yourself to no one but three individuals: your inner child, your inner old dude, and the version of you that loves themselves fully
- To always make time to be in nature away from the trappings of civilized life
- To not accept words in lieu of action. Talk is cheap.
