# The Street Light

On that long empty suburban street he pumped his little feet. The noise from the rubber of his tires against the rough asphalt was increasing masked by the wooshing of the air trying to push him away. Pumping his little legs as hard as he could until they just about fell off, he closed his eyes and imagined he was flying. The passing street lights above flickered like someone was playing iwth the light switch: on - off - on - off - on. 

He couldnt fly for long. The end of the road approached him quickly. The last street light waiting for him. Its spolight where he could be awarded first place and a new speed record in his little race against himself. 

Beyond that streetlight was rocks, dirt, pokey little bugs, and pokey little bushs that absolutely under no circumstances wanted to be touched ever. In the distance stood a set of four tall mountains that crowded next to each other in a single file line. The bare boney fingers reached out of the dusty desert reaching for a sky that was just out of its reach. 

He stood now under that last streetlight on the little concrete berm sperating the asphalt of his road from the wilderness that belonged to the fingers. His bike sprawled on the road behind him. The day was almost over but the sun still beamed heat. The fingers threw a warm wind filled with little specks of dust. They hurt his eyes but he didnt mind. Under that street light he felt a nice chill. His heart was pumping hard and the breeze felt cool against his sweaty face and legs. 

Something about that felt off. But he sushed that thought. We wasnt a little kid anymore and only little kids got scared. The coldness under that streetlight felt nice. And the best part, standing on that little concrete border he could have a front row seat to his favorite part of this terrible neighborhood in this terrible city in the terrible southwest. 

The sunsets here were incomparable. The whole sky lit on fire and light danced around the moody clouds that glowed like embers. As the sun hid, the fingers now free from that heavenly eye pierced deep into the skin of the sky and a deep red spilled as far as he could see, dripping over him and the rocks and houses alike. 

As the last of the light faded away the fingers turned their attention to him. The shadows of the fingers reached towards him, racing against the falling night. They stretched far but could only reach as far as a tall cactus filled with holes that stood a short distance from that streetlight. They could almost reach him. Almost.

The boy turned around and left and the fingers grapsed that cactus.

Him and his parents had moved here a little over six weeks ago but to him it felt like an eternity. Alone here he begged his parents to go back but they didnt budge an inch. The worst part is they wouldnt even tell him why they had to leave their home and come to this terrible place. He missed his old neighborhood, his old friends, even his old elementary school. 

Here it was just hot. Nothing but endless heat and endless roads and endless boring beige houses that all looked the same. Even the days looked the same. Lights would turn on and off. The occasional car would drive by, but unlike the little cars he was used to these big beasts stared down the road with bright eyes as they rushed from one dusty boring place to another. To him they looked like big beetles and that thought made him sad. There were no fireflies here.

They promised that once he would start school in a few weeks he will make new friends and everything will be okay. But he didnt want to be okay. He didnt want new friends. He wanted his old friends. His old life. 

His parents bought him a bike and a matching ugly helmet in their second week here to bribe him out of his room that he refused to leave. When he saw the bike he pretended to hate it but instantly fell in love. 

He wanted to learn how to fly so he could leave this terrible place and go back to his real home, away from these angry plants and dead rocks and terrible heat. So he practiced how to fly every day. Faster and faster, on his bike he pretended. He was sure that if he could go fast enough, and if he could find some wings to add to the side, that he could really take flight. And until he found his wings we would work on his speed. 

The neighboorhood his parents moved into was dull and unending. No matter in which direction he went, which turns he tooks, the houses all looked the same. Dull beige with a driveway in front and angry plants in a yard filled with rocks. They looked as sad and dead as the desert beyond that last streetlight. 

[ bike around looking for wings and meeting characters? or trim this piece seems irrelevant. too long or needs to be much longer]

His favorite part of that neighborhood was that last road that lead up to that streetlight and the fingers beyond. Long and straight. No cars. No speed bumps. Just a long flat road that would one day be his runway out of this place. 
---
Tonight, like every evening, he prepared for takeoff. He tightned the strap of his helmet and the lace of his shoes. He stood over his bike staring down the long runway. He was going to fly. He started pumping his legs. The lights would flicker on and off. He would come to rest at that last streetlight.

It was cool under that last light, always cooler than the runway leading up to it. That warm air trying to push him to the ground disappeared. The cool air felt nice but he didnt like to stay there long. He felt weird there. The same weird feeling he got when we got out of bed late at night for water and had to cross his empty house. The darkness felt like it was alive and hugnry. Like there was something in that darkness waiting for him. He didnt admit it to anyone but that feeling terrified him. In his home, when he had to make the journey from his room to the kitchen he would sprint from light to light where he felt safe from the darkness. But at 3am his house was terrifying. Here, at the time of sunset, the feeling was a mild creep. He thought there was something here too, deep in that dead desert. Maybe thats why the plants were angry, full of knives pointed out. But under that streetlight on the asphalt of his runway he felt safe. Anyhow, he only stayed till sunset. Never when it became dark. He left long before the creep could turn into terror. 

The wind was blowing extra hard today. The trees dancing in that wind yelling loudly and swinging their arms windly as if crossing them. Dust pelted his face and he squint his eyes tight to protect them. But he didnt stop. It was time to take off and he was going to fly. Pump pump pump pump. on - off - on - off - on. Woooooooosh. 

The was blind by the time he got halfway through the runway from the dust in his eyes but he knew when the end of the runway was coming. Even in this wild wind he could feel the air become colder. Slow now he rubbed his eyes and saw the dim glow of the streetlight ahead. He stayed on his bike but walked it forward until he was under that spotlight. The air that was normally chilly was downright cold. He had goosebumps. As he crossed the threshold of light, the wind slowed down, the trees froze, the dust settled, and he saw a sky so clear it was unlike any other day he had seen before. All was quiet for the performance that was about to start. All, except for the fulttering of a bird he couldnt quite see. While waiting for the show to start he looked around but everything looked frozen. He gave up and got comforable straddling his bike. He had a strong urge to go home but he decided to stay for the show.

And the show did not dissapoint. Bright yellow gave way to orange then red. The fingers reached deeper into the sky until the rich maroon spilled out like blood. The sun was almost hidden. 

The boy watched with wonder as the show took a different turn. Instead of going dark towards black, the sky turned into a deep purple. The color reminded him of a bruise he once had from falling off his bike-ugly and painful. The color unsettled him. But this new show held him spellbound. Like that bruise the day after, the the purple grew richer and putrid. It took on a green tint as the blood that normally drained away now pooled and grew infected. The sunset that used to look like a vibrant dance of fire now looked bedridden, pale, and sickly. The color of the sky brought up the memory of looking at his grandpa as he laid in his casket-that dead skin had the same green tint. The boy didnt realize this, but a tear escaped out of his eye and fled. [too direct?]

[ something about a dead wind and the smell of sweet death ]

He did not notice when the warm tear froze on his cheek. A sob bubbled out involuntarily. He stared, his mind blank except for a small vine growing from a seed of panic which now gripped his spine. The shadow of the fingers was reaching towards him. It grasped towards that cactus as a child would grasp for a toy hiding in the dark mouth below the couch, unable to see yet feeling around of its target. 

The air was freezing cold now. As cold as it used to get in the depths of winter where is real home stood. He thought of that empty living room where a fireplace once burned warm, now empty and cold. His feet froze into the ground. 

The purple and green sky alight with no sun, looking something like it stumbled past death and into some form new life, watched with a passive emptyness at the fingers, reaching towards the little boy who wanted to fly. His legs, icycles, froze deep into the ground. He could only watch as the shadow hand creeped closer, that cactus almost within its grasp.

His breath now rapid, the little clouds scrambling out of his mouth disappearing into the air. Despite the cold air a new layer of sweat glisted over the mountainous goosebumps that covered his whole body. The seed of panic that was sown rapidly took root and every part of his body was screaming to break away and run. But he couldnt. He was held firmly in place, like a plastic soldier is held in place helpless to change his fate as a toy train barrels towards him.

The fingers reached past the cactus now. The shadow kept creeping towards him. Warm liquid dripped down his legs and down his bike frame. The liquid pooled round his feet, at first steaming but now ice, further locking him in place. His heart pounded loudly against the cage it was trapped in, desperate to be set free. 

[ emphasize better he is still on his bike, that it is so silent. earlier, mention constant noise to contrast ]

The shadow of the fingers were now just outside the threshold of the streetlight, somehow maintaining their form inspite of the the streetlight, reaching closer still. Just as they were to cross that concrete barrier and enter the land of man, a boy was struck from behind. [fluttering wings?] He felt a punch and right after searing pain that flowered across his back and then his body. The feeling of sensation snapped him back into his senses and for a moment the force holding him down flinched. In an instant the world came back to life: the wind screaming and the branches waving wilding in the wind. 

He put his feet back onto his pedals and raced away from that grasping hand and that streetlight which seperated the world of concrete and beige houses and the world of the boney fingers and that sky of bruised skin. 

Through the dust and tears his world was reduced to blobs of colors, black, gray, purple, and green. He pumped his legs. On - off - on - off. The wind, usually pushing against him, now propelled him away from that terrible shadow creeping after him. He didnt dare turn around. [add buzzing? or too much?]

The vines grown from that seed of panic now penetrated his entire being. In his mind there was a singlular feeling of panic. All other thoughts had gone dark. All he could do was pump his little legs. The hand was right behind him. The darkness growing stronger. Swallowing the lights he had just passed. 

Though he was pumping his legs harder than he had ever before, the air grew cold again. He pumped his legs harder still, harder than his bike could handle. Ice touched the back of his neck. He wailed. 

Through the dust and tears his world was reduced to blobs of colors, black, gray, purple, and green. And now two bright eyes that looked straight at him. He dove into the arms of his savior, the one who would save him from this cold nightmare. He splat across the windshield of a car with its highbeams on. The maddening panic gave way to a darkness much kinder than the one pursuing him. 
---
He awoke in a strage place and immedietly begain to wail loudly. He tried to kick his legs, to pump his pedals away from that darkness that was still chasing him, but was unable to. He felt a cold hand on his forehead and screamed. Through his tears he saw the green and purple above and that seed of panic took root once more. He lost his mind, was unconsolabe. He didnt notice the syringe plunge deep into his arm. A wimper escaped his lips. Sweet darkness took him in its loving embrace once more.

Hot tears stung her eyes. She gripped her clammy cold hands together tightly, fingers interlaced. Her nails dug deeply, drawing a few drops of blood. She didnt notice. The boy's mother watched helplessly as the doctors and nurses tried to calm down her boy. She was desperate to know who did this to him. No one had answers. 

It killed her to see his lively eyes now frantic with panic. His soft smooth skin now spoiled with dark bruises black and green. The skin she could see, anyway. Most of her boy was hidden behind white gauze and thick straps that held him down to the hospital bed, saving him from causing more damage to himself and those near him. She didnt know what she hated more, the person who did this to him, who hurt him, or the sheer panic that erupted when he arose out of his sedation, or the drugs that took away her son and left behind this broken boy. 

She tore her eyes away from this miserable scene. To her right, a wide window overlooked the campus. Beyond the buildings and parking lot were houses that eventually gave way to the desert and those mountains that were everpresent across the whole city. It was sunset. The sky was a deep red that reminded her of blood. For a moment, her thoughts broke free from thinking about her boy and what she was going to do when she found the person who hurt him. The sky commanded her attention. Full of colors she had never seen before. Dark red gave way to purple that grew so deep. Though the sun was set, the sky still shown brightly. Tints of green emerged. As she gazed upon that unusual sky her thoughts returned back to her boy bruised and battered. Lost in her thoughts again, she didnt notice the streetlights below flicker. The darkness grew a little darker.
