# My Experiences and Rewards from the Upadhan

The upadhan is a special taap within the Jain religion. [Some background about the tap here](./upadhan_background.md). 

The upadhan taap is most intense - considered to be the most challenging taap within the Shvetambar tradition. How can this taap beat out something as intense as a 30 day water fast? It is because the participant must live the life of a monk in addition to intense fasting and prayer. The austerity is the challenge and the reward is a insight so deep it sinks below words and feelings down directly to the soul. I am a spiritual explorer. In my short life of many various expereinces, this is the crown. 

It is challenging to document what I got from this taap. Much of it is feeling. A part of me does not want to share - it feels too personal. Somehow like sharing a potent dream, sharing my deeper experinces from this taap will diminish its power. Another challenge is a human one. How can I describe the atma and what this taap does to it in words? How can I attempt to describe the feeling and power of mantras and give it any form of justice? This all exists beyond the limits of the mind and reason. 

I look to my guru for guidance. He asked me "Do you feel the Navkar Mantra is alive?" I do. I feel it. He replied, "Then, it is our duty to share it. To try and inspire others." I am just another regular human like you. I dont know how much I can inspire. My goal is to simply share my experiences and feelings. I hope something in this text resonates with you and that if you feel the calling from your soul to undertake something similar, you heed it.

## Intro

Imagine a pyramid with three layers. Everything I received from this taap lives in one of the three layers. I will use this framework to organize my experiences and outcome, starting from the bottom up.

## Spritual 
- Connection to, appreciation of, and wisdom from monks
- A deep feeling, a revelation of, the heart of spirituality

- An intuitive understanding of what it means for a mantra to be "alive"
